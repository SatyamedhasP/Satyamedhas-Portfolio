# [Project 1: Heart Disease Prediction - ML Project](https://github.com/SatyamedhasP/Satyamedhas-Portfolio/blob/main/Data%20Science%20Projects/Heart%20Disease%20Prediction/Heart_Disease_Prediction.ipynb)

Objective: To predict heart diseases for skin cancer and diabetic patients.

Dataset Source: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kamilpytlak/personal-key-indicators-of-heart-disease) 

- Utilized a dataset of 300k+ rows to construct a classification model to predict whether a patient has a heart disease or not following CRISP-DM
- Prediction model was focused on patients who were diagnosed with skin cancer and diabetes.
- Various ML models such as Artificial neural nets, Logistic regression, Na√Øve Bayes, Random Forest, Decision Trees and k-NN were designed.
- Best model (Logistic Regression) achieved an accuracy of 83%. Scoring metrics were based on precision, recall, accuracy, f-1 score, ROC and AUC.
- With the help of GridSearchCV the accuracy was increased to 83.42% for the Logistic Regression model.
- Libraries used: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
